      <img src="assets/images/myportfoliophoto copy.png" class="auth-image" alt="Diana Gandy">

      <p>My name is Diana and I am a web developer. I to relocated to Austin in 2014 to persue a new career and cross Hill Country BBQ off of my bucket list. I initially got into code when a friend suggested I try to learn recursion on JavaScript and quickly discovered I was a masochist that enjoyed the frustration of working through the debugging process. My favorite coding languages are Javascript and Ruby with my topic of choice being reccursion. Actually, you should probably check out some of my work in the Portfolio section of this page.</p>

      <p>Are you still reading this section? Oh. *slowly places brisket back on plate* A little about me, I really enjoy science, hiking, geochaching, and Opera(genre > webbrowser). Most weekends you would probably find me in a musuem or at the park working on code while puppy watching. If there is anything else you would like to know about me feel free to send me a message in the Contact section of my page.</p>
